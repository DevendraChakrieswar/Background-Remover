## 60–90 second spoken script

Hi, I built Background Remover, an AI‑powered image tool that removes backgrounds with a single upload. It’s a three‑tier system: a React + Vite frontend for a fast, clean UX; a Spring Boot API for validation and orchestration; and a Python ML microservice that runs U²‑Net via rembg to generate high‑quality alpha mattes.

Here’s how it works: the user uploads an image from the React app. The Spring API sanitizes and validates it, then calls the Python service’s /remove-bg endpoint. The ML service keeps the U²‑Net model warm in memory, runs inference, and returns a transparent PNG. The UI shows a before/after slider for quick visual QA and lets the user download the cut‑out.

I chose this split because Java is great for robust APIs, security, and payments, while Python is ideal for modern ML. Decoupling them means I can scale ML workers independently and iterate on the model without touching the API. I also added health checks, basic metrics, and clear error handling. The next steps are async job processing for very large images, object storage with signed URLs, and optional GPU workers for higher throughput. Overall, it’s production‑friendly, easy to extend, and gives crisp results around fine details like hair.

## One‑slide architecture diagram (Mermaid)

Paste this Mermaid diagram into a Markdown slide or any Mermaid‑compatible tool.

### Diagram legend
- C: React client handles UX, upload, and before/after slider.
- A: Spring Boot API validates inputs, coordinates ML calls, and streams results.
- M: Python Flask service hosts U²‑Net via rembg, returns alpha‑matted PNGs.
- Storage: local folders (`uploads/`, `results/`); can be swapped for S3/Azure Blob with signed URLs.

### Speaker hints (optional one‑liners)
- Performance: Model loads once and stays warm; scale ML horizontally when needed.
- Quality: U²‑Net preserves fine edges; post‑processing minimizes halos.
- Security: File-type and size checks; Spring Security/JWT ready for protected tiers.
- Roadmap: Async jobs, object storage + CDN, GPU pool for bursts, background replacement options.
